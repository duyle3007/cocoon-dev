      <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        The web site is owned and operated by Cocoon Luxury Properties Pty Ltd
        and will be referred to as ‘We’, ‘our’, and ‘us’ in this Internet
        Privacy Policy. By using this site, you agree to the Internet Privacy
        Policy of this web site (“the web site”), which is set out on this web
        site page. The Internet Privacy Policy relates to the collection and use
        of personal information you may supply to us through your conduct on the
        web site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove
        portions of this Internet Privacy Policy at any time. This Internet
        Privacy Policy is in addition to any other terms and conditions
        applicable to the web site. We do not make any representations about
        third party web sites that may be linked to the web site. We recognise
        the importance of protecting the privacy of information collected about
        visitors to our web site, in particular information that is capable of
        identifying an individual (“personal information”). This Internet
        Privacy Policy governs the manner in which your personal information,
        obtained through the web site, will be dealt with. This Internet Privacy
        Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any
        changes. We welcome your comments and feedback.
      </div>

      <h4>Personal Information</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        Personal information about visitors to our site is collected only when
        knowingly and voluntarily submitted. For example, we may need to collect
        such information to provide you with further services or to answer or
        forward any requests or enquiries. It is our intention that this policy
        will protect your personal information from being dealt with in any way
        that is inconsistent with applicable privacy laws in Australia.
      </div>

      <h4>Use of Information</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        Personal information that visitors submit to our site is used only for
        the purpose for which it is submitted or for such other secondary
        purposes that are related to the primary purpose, unless we disclose
        other uses in this Internet Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.
        Copies of correspondence sent from the web site, that may contain
        personal information, are stored as archives for record-keeping and
        back-up purposes only.
      </div>

      <h4>Disclosure</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which regulate
        how Australian Government agencies may collect, store, use and disclose
        personal information, and how individuals may access and correct
        personal information held about them. A copy of the Australian Privacy
        Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the
        Australian Information Commissioner at www.oaic.gov.au
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        Apart from where you have consented or disclosure is necessary to
        achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, personal information may
        be disclosed in special situations where we have reason to believe that
        doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
        anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or
        unintentionally) with our rights or property, users, or anyone else who
        could be harmed by such activities. Also, we may disclose personal
        information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
        disclosure. v 7. We may engage third parties to provide you with goods
        or services on our behalf. In that circumstance, we may disclose your
        personal information to those third parties in order to meet your
        request for goods or services.
      </div>

      <h4>Collecting Information from Users</h4>

      <h4>Comments</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in

        An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a
        hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using

        public in the context of your comment.
      </div>

      <h4>Media</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images
        with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website
        can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
      </div>

      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name,
        email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so
        that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave
        another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine
        if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data
        and is discarded when you close your browser.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login
        information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two
        days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select
        “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of
        your account, the login cookies will be removed.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in
        your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates
        the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
      </div>

      <h4>Embedded content from other websites</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
        articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the
        exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
        third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded
        content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content
        if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
      </div>

      <h4>Who we share your data with</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>

        reset email.
      </div>

      <h4>How long we retain your data</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
        indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
        comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
        personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can
        see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
        cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
        edit that information.
      </div>

      <h4>What rights you have over your data</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can
        request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
        you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
        that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include
        any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security
        purposes.

        service.
      </div>

      <h4>Links to other sites</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
        We provide links to Web sites outside of our web sites, as well as to
        third party Web sites. These linked sites are not under our control, and
        we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to
        our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other
        website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that
        Web site and its privacy statement.

      <h4>Problems or questions</h4>
      <div className={styles.content}>
